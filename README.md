- Every **task** has a unique identifier that should be used in PR title
- Create a GitHub repository, create a different branch (eg: solution). Then create a PR (pull request). Without any pull request (PR), it won't be accepted. Because
  to do code review, PR is required due to feedback and communication regarding codebase.
- In this repository create a issue in this format (**Review required for Task # [TASK_IDENTIFIER]**).
